**Brief about the Tutorial**

The tutorial is inspired from the following paper, **Chandrasekaran *et al.*, "Chemogenomics and orthology‐based design of antibiotic combination therapies", *Mol Syst Biol (2016)12:872***, you can view the paper [here](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.15252/msb.20156777).

It uses chemogenomic data profile of various antibiotics *i.e.* interaction between chemical drug and gene to predict interaction score between two antibiotics in *Escherichia coli*.

**Chemogenomic Profiling**

Chemogenomic profile measures fitness of gene‐knockout strains treated with a particular antibiotic.

The chemogenomic data profile of different antibiotics is made available from, **Nichols *et al.*, "Phenotypic landscape of a bacterial cell", *Cell 144: 143-156 (2011)***, you can view the paper [here](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)01374-7). The chemogenomic dataset provided has data of 324 different drug conditions and 3979 genes. 

Here is the sample of chemogenomic profile of Amoxicillin in different conditions with different genes
